# Contributions Welcome!

Please submit a PR if you want something to be improved. If you would like
to help maintain this project I will add you to the maintainer system only after
the first successful PR.

## Play nice.

I think that [Code of Conducts](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
are nice but it is simply expressed through: Please play nice with others.

## Use tools

`npm run validate` tells you if the code you want to submit is "valid". Use it.
Also the development tools for the standard syntax help.

## No Version in PR's

We generate a new version after a PR. This means a PR should not contain a Version
number.
